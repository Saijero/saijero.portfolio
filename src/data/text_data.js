    <br/>
    <br/>
    At first, I wasn't aware that we could create our own scripts to streamline processes. My brother noticed what I was doing and informed me that our work could be automated using scripts. Intrigued, I decided to explore this possibility. I began researching how to write code online and started coding.
    <br/>

    Eventually, I successfully created my own script to automate the tasks I was working on. From that point on, I no longer had to manually perform those tasks; I automated the entire system using my own scripting code.`
